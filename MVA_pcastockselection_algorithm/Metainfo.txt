Name of Quantlet: MVApcapfalgo
 
Published in: MVA

Description: 'This quantlet applies the selection algorithm based on principal component analysis to identify           stocks, which have contributed heavily to the movement in the original portfolio. In each step the algorithm 
applies pca to the correlation matrix of stocks not removed yet. Eigenvectors are selected associated with 
eigenvalues smaller than one. Stocks with the highest absolute weight in these eigenvectors are removed. This 
step is repeated until either the number of remaining stocks reaches a predefined threshold or the remaining 
eigenvalues are sufficiently close to each other.'

Keywords: pca, returns, stock selection, portfolio management, eigenvalues, eigenvectors

Output: "One plot illustrating how in each step the maximum bilateral correlation and the number of constituents 
is reduced. Furthermore an object containing equal weighted portfolios with all and the selected stocks are saved 
in a file.""
