Name of Quantlet: MVApcapfalgo
 
Published in: MVA

Description: 'This quantlet applies the selection algorithm based on principal component
analysis to identify stocks, which have contributed heavily to the movement in the
original portfolio. In each step the algorithm applies pca to the correlation matrix of
stocks not removed yet. Eigenvectors are selected associated with eigenvalues smaller
than one. Stocks with the highest absolute weight in these eigenvectors are removed.
This step is repeated until either the number of remaining stocks reaches a predefined
threshold or the remaining eigenvalues are sufficiently close to each other. 
Furthermore the algorithm is applied for different scale parameter values.'

Keywords: pca, returns, stock selection, portfolio management, eigenvalues, eigenvectors

Output: Output: 'Two plots illustrating how the result of the algorithm depends on the 
selected scale parameter. Furthermore based on the selected assets an equal 
weighted portfolio is constructed and saved in a .dat file'
